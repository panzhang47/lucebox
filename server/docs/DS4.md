# DeepSeek V4 Flash — DFlash Integration

This document describes the current DeepSeek V4 Flash implementation in DFlash. DeepSeek4 supports the layer-split target path and an opt-in DSpark speculative path. The DSpark proposal blocks can run in a separate HIP process while the complete target remains local.

## Model Architecture

DeepSeek V4 Flash is a 43-layer MoE model with:

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Hidden dim (`n_embd`) | 4096 |
| Attention heads | 64 (MLA: 1 KV head, low-rank Q/O projections) |
| Head dim | 512 (partial RoPE on 64 dims, YaRN scaling) |
| Experts per layer | 256 routed (top-6) + 1 shared |
| Expert FFN dim | 2048 |
| First 3 layers routing | Hash-based (token ID → expert table) |
| Remaining layers routing | Top-k over learned router + optional bias |
| KV Compression | Learned compressor (ratio-4 even, ratio-128 odd) |
| Indexer | Top-k scorer on ratio-4 layers for compressed KV selection |
| HC (Hierarchical Controller) | 4 parallel residual streams, Sinkhorn-normalized combine |

## Forward Pass (Layer-Split Path)

`deepseek4_step_layer_range()` drives per-shard execution over a contiguous layer range:

1. **Embedding + HC init** — On the first shard (`layer_begin == 0`), token embeddings are replicated into all HC streams to initialize the per-token HC state.
2. **Per-layer forward** — Each layer runs the HC-enabled sequence: HC pre (attention) → MLA attention → HC post (attention) → HC pre (FFN) → router + MoE FFN → HC post (FFN).
3. **Decode HC fast path** — For single-token decode (`n_tokens == 1`), the runtime reuses cached decode graphs. CUDA decode uses the cached backend HC graph path; HIP decode uses the direct HC-pre helper plus refreshed HC-post weights.
4. **Shard boundary handoff** — Non-final shards return the updated **full HC state tensor** (`n_tokens × n_hc × n_embd`) to the next shard.
5. **Tail shard completion** — The last shard resumes at its `layer_begin`, runs the remaining layers, then performs the final HC merge, RMSNorm, and `lm_head` projection to produce logits.

The production DeepSeek4 path does **not** use the retired per-expert worker split. The MoE computation stays inside the shard that owns each layer.

## Execution Modes

### Local single-shard

If the adapter decides all 43 layers fit on one CUDA GPU, it loads a single shard locally and no IPC daemon is involved.

### Local multi-shard

When the server is configured with an explicit local layer split across multiple GPUs, the adapter loads each contiguous shard locally and executes them in order.

### CUDA parent + Halo target-shard split

For heterogeneous setups, the CUDA-built server can keep the prefix layers on the CUDA GPU and launch the suffix shard on the Halo/HIP build through the existing target-shard IPC path:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  CUDA Parent                                                │
│  - Token embedding                                          │
│  - Layers [0, split)                                        │
│  - Maintains local KV/cache state for its layer range       │
│  - Emits updated HC-state tensor at the shard boundary      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Halo Target Shard (IPC daemon)                             │
│  - Layers [split, 43)                                       │
│  - Resumes from boundary HC state                           │
│  - Final HC merge, RMSNorm, lm_head                         │
│  - Returns logits / sampled token to the parent             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

This path uses `TargetShardIpcSession`, `deepseek4_target_shard_ipc_daemon.cpp`, and `BackendIpcMode::DeepSeek4TargetShard` rather than the old expert-worker protocol.

### Local target + remote HIP DSpark draft

The speculative IPC mode keeps the complete DeepSeek4 target, KV cache, tied
embedding, DSpark head, and sampler in the parent. A separate
`BackendIpcMode::DeepSeek4DSparkDraft` process executes the DSpark proposal
graph on the selected HIP GPU. The parent currently retains its locally loaded
draft weights for metadata and fallback; removing that duplicate residency is
a separate optimization.

Each speculative step transfers:

- target feature captures in token-major
  `[n_tokens, n_target_layers, n_embd]` layout;
- the embedded seed/MASK proposal block;
- the proposal hidden states returned by the HIP worker.

All target-layer captures are uploaded as one feature block and one
acknowledgement. On POSIX hosts this mode defaults to the existing memfd-backed
shared payload transport; proposal input and output reuse the same mapping.
`stream` remains available as an A/B and compatibility fallback. This is shared
host IPC, not direct `hipIpcMemHandle` peer memory.

## Shard Boundary State

The shard boundary transfers the **full HC state tensor**, not a separate expert-routing payload:

- **Boundary activation / HC state** — `[n_tokens × n_hc × n_embd]` floats. DeepSeek4 uses `n_hc = 4`, so the per-token boundary payload is `4 × 4096` floats.
- **Sequence position / token metadata** — enough information for the tail shard to continue cache updates and finish the forward pass.

KV cache tensors remain owned by the shard that owns the corresponding layer range.

## Auto-Split Behavior

If DeepSeek4 is started without an explicit target layer split, `DeepSeek4LayerSplitAdapter` computes the CUDA prefix automatically:

1. Read `DFLASH_DS4_CUDA_LAYERS`. If it is set to a positive value, that value becomes the number of prefix layers kept on CUDA.
2. Otherwise, query CUDA free memory.
3. Reserve a fixed **2 GiB** overhead for caches and safety margin.
4. Estimate roughly **1.9 GiB per DeepSeek4 layer**.
5. Clamp the result so at least one layer remains on each side (`1..42`), then assign the remaining `43 - N` layers to Halo.

The runtime logs the chosen split with a `[deepseek4-split] auto-split:` banner.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `DFLASH_DS4_CUDA_LAYERS` | Override the auto-split heuristic and pin the first `N` DeepSeek4 layers to CUDA. The remaining `43 - N` layers run on the Halo shard. |
| `DFLASH_DS4_TIMING` | Enable DS4 timing logs for the layer-split parent and target-shard daemon. Useful for profiling prefill/decode breakdowns; leave unset for normal runs. |
| `DFLASH_DS4_SPEC` | Enable the DeepSeek4 DSpark speculative runtime. |
| `DFLASH_DS4_DRAFT` | DSpark draft GGUF loaded locally for metadata/head use and by the remote worker. |
| `DFLASH_DS4_DRAFT_IPC_BIN` | Backend IPC daemon executable used for the remote DSpark worker. |
| `DFLASH_DS4_DRAFT_IPC_GPU` | HIP device index for the remote DSpark proposal blocks. |
| `DFLASH_DS4_DRAFT_IPC_WORK_DIR` | Scratch directory for the child process. |
| `DFLASH_DS4_DRAFT_IPC_REQUIRED` | Fail initialization instead of falling back to a local draft when remote startup fails. |
| `DFLASH_DRAFT_IPC_TRANSPORT` | Payload transport: `auto`, `shared`, or `stream`. DeepSeek4 DSpark defaults to `auto`; other draft modes retain their existing default. |

`DFLASH_DS4_TIMING` enables the existing timing banners:

- parent / local shard: `[deepseek4-split-timing]`
- remote Halo shard: `[deepseek4-target-timing]`

DeepSeek4 no longer uses the old expert-split environment variables or expert-worker tuning knobs. Those retired knobs were removed from the codebase rather than left behind as unsupported debug switches.

## DSpark Speculative Decode

DeepSeek4 uses the shared DFlash DSpark head implementation together with a
DeepSeek4-specific three-layer drafter and fused target verification. The draft
GGUF carries its auxiliary projections under the existing `dflash.dspark.*`
tensor contract. DeepSeek4/MTP checkpoints store compatible heads under the
`mtp.2.*` namespace, which the converter maps as follows.

Supported DeepSeek4/MTP input tensors:

| DeepSeek4/MTP tensor | GGUF tensor |
|----------------------|-------------|
| `mtp.2.markov_head.markov_w1.weight` | `dflash.dspark.markov.w1` |
| `mtp.2.markov_head.markov_w2.weight` | `dflash.dspark.markov.w2` |
| `mtp.2.confidence_head.proj.weight` | `dflash.dspark.confidence.weight` |
| `mtp.2.confidence_head.proj.bias` | `dflash.dspark.confidence.bias` |

If the MTP confidence projection is bias-less, the converter writes a zero
bias so the GGUF loader still sees the pair it expects. The Markov head alone
is enough for DSpark greedy-chain correction; confidence gating remains
optional.

Example conversion with the DS4 MTP shard that contains the DSpark heads:

```bash
python server/scripts/convert_dflash_to_gguf.py \
  /path/to/dflash-draft/model.safetensors \
  /path/to/dflash-draft.gguf \
  --aux-heads /path/to/hf-ds4-flash-dspark/model-00048-of-00048.safetensors
```

Run the converted drafter against a DeepSeek4 target with:

```bash
export DFLASH_DS4_SPEC=1
export DFLASH_DS4_FUSED_VERIFY=1
export DFLASH_DS4_DRAFT=/path/to/dflash-draft.gguf
export DFLASH_DS4_SPEC_Q=4

./server/build-hip/dflash_server /path/to/deepseek4-target.gguf
```

Adaptive width is automatic. When the draft artifact has a compatible
confidence projection, the runtime selects q=2, q=3, or q=4 from the cumulative
confidence of the proposed prefix. It adds the projection to the same fused
Markov graph and reads its scores in the existing token-id synchronization; no
additional host round trip is introduced. Artifacts without a compatible
confidence head transparently retain the existing acceptance-EWMA policy.

On the gfx1151 validation host, confidence-adaptive width retained 10/10
GSM+Math accuracy and measured 29.25 tok/s weighted, within 0.8% of fixed q=4
at 29.49 tok/s. On the low-acceptance stress prompt it measured 21.9/21.8
tok/s warm, effectively tied with EWMA while avoiding fixed q=4's wasted wide
verification. These numbers are workload-specific; the confidence policy is
opt-in.

## Example: CUDA + Halo Layer Split

Automatic split (CUDA prefix chosen from free memory, optional manual override via `DFLASH_DS4_CUDA_LAYERS`):

```bash
export DFLASH_DS4_CUDA_LAYERS=24   # optional

./server/build-cuda/dflash_server /opt/models/DeepSeek-V4-Flash.gguf \
  --target-device cuda:0 \
  --target-shard-ipc-bin $PWD/server/build-hip/backend_ipc_daemon \
  --target-shard-ipc-work-dir $PWD/server/target_shard_ipc \
  --port 8213
```

Explicit mixed-backend split using the generic target-shard flags:

```bash
./server/build-cuda/dflash_server /opt/models/DeepSeek-V4-Flash.gguf \
  --target-devices cuda:0,hip:0 \
  --target-layer-split 24,19 \
  --target-shard-ipc-bin $PWD/server/build-hip/backend_ipc_daemon \
  --target-shard-ipc-work-dir $PWD/server/target_shard_ipc \
  --port 8213
```

## Performance Notes

- **Split granularity is coarse and stable**: the boundary moves by whole layers.
- **Boundary traffic is HC-state traffic**: the remote handoff is the full HC-state tensor for the current token batch.
- **Decode has backend-specific HC paths**:
  - CUDA decode uses cached backend HC graphs.
  - HIP decode uses the direct HC-pre helper plus host-refreshed HC-post weights.
- **Auto-split is only a heuristic**: override `DFLASH_DS4_CUDA_LAYERS` when you want a reproducible split or when empirical throughput differs from the simple memory estimate.
